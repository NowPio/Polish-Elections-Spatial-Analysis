# Exploratory Spatial Analysis of 2019 Polish Elections

This repository contains a spatial analysis of Polish 2019 parliamentary elections. You can find here a .pdf file (without R codes for readability) and .qmd (including all codes needed for creating the .pdf file). I tried to keep the analysis as brief as possible so some stuff might have been omitted. However, you might be interested in graphs and overall results.
